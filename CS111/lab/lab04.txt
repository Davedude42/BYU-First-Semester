Q1 & Q2:
1. Parse user input and commands.
    - Identify commands and parameters given by user
    - Error if an invalid command is given
2. Run given commands
    - Function is needed for every possible command
    - Functions should be given parameters
         - And give error if parameters are not valid
    - Give error if something goes wrong
    - Q3: Specific commands and functions need to be broken down further!!!
3. Return result
    - Be able to output in different ways (to file, to image viewer)



Q4:
displayImage   -d file_name
grayscaleImage -g file_name
sepiaImage     -s file_name
darkenImage    -e file_name factor
borderImage    -b file_name width red green blue
vertFlipImage  -v file_name
horizFlipImage -h file_name
collageImages  -c file_name1 file_name2 file_name3 file_name4 width
greenImage     -g file_name threshold factor

Q5:
We used the first letter of the function because that would make the most since. When we got to darken however, -d had already been used, so we picked another letter randomly: -e. We can't make it too easy.

Q6:
They all require file_name, but otherwise they have varying amounts and types of parameters. We will likely want to give the parameters to the functions as strings rather than parsing them as numbers beforehand.

Q7:
We will want to verify that the user is giving a valid command flag
We will want to verify that the path to the image exists.
We will want each function to verify its own parameters: that there is the right number and that they are each the right type and within the right range.

Q8:
If the file_name given is inaccessible, it will quit after printing:
ERROR!! :((( The image "MY IMAGE.exe.jpg" could not be found. Type `ls` then the enter key before running this again. (The enter key is the one on the far right btw.)

If there is the wrong length of parameters, it will quit after printing:
ERROR!! :((( The darkenImage function requires 2 parameters: file_name, factor. Only 1 was given. You can count, can't you?

If a parameter is the wrong type or out of range, the function with quit after printing:
ERROR!! :((( The red parameter must be between 0 and 255. -inf was given. Do you really think you could handle -inf red?

Q9:
I will need to learn better file input, to verify a file exists and give a proper error if it doesn't.
I will need to learn image manipulation in python. How to read an image, parse it, modify it, and put it back into a file.
Also, I'll need to learn how to show in image in the standard image viewer on linux on my computer, because I imagine it's harder than it needs to be.

Q10:
It used -k for darken instead of -e for darken. Personally, I think -e makes far more sense and honestly the autograder should be changed to match it.
