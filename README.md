## Why I chose this medium

I wanted to program something. That is my medium of choice for most things. However, I really couldn't think of something to program that would demonstrate my growth and learning over the semester. While I was thinking about what to make, I was scrolling through my camera roll and found photos of the results of many things I programmed this semester, and I realized that they all demonstrate my growth. So, I decided to compile them together to be a culmination and reflection of all my work this semester. 

## How My Programming Demonstrates My Growth

These all represent massive growth in me.

The class assignments obviously represent what I've learned over the semester. But, it's everything else that demonstrates my growth the most. I've come to learn that the most difficult programs to write are the unassigned ones, with no promise that the problem will be within your current scope of knowledge, but that's where growth comes from. Many of these programs challenged me, and many of them required me to apply what I had learned from previous problems. It is like spiral growth.

## Key question: How is being here helping me become who I want to be?

I think this collection of projects has most showed me how often I can use my skills outside of just computer class--to help others, to bring joy, and to be part of something larger. Those are the things I want to do, and BYU has shown me how I can.
